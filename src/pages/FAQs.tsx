            <div>
                <Heading>What areas do you service?</Heading>
                <p>Until we expand further, our services can be available in the Eatonville, Puyallup, Graham, Tacoma,
                    and Sumner, Edgewood areas. For large-scale projects (6-8 hours, we're more than willing to travel
                    up to 1-1.5 hours from Eatonville).</p>
                <Heading>What types of spaces can you clean?</Heading>
                <p>Commonly cleaned spaces involve homes, staging of homes for real estate or events, offices, small
                    businesses.</p>
                <Heading>What is the difference between regular maintenance and a deep clean?</Heading>
                <p>Regular Maintenance is if your space is generally clean, lacks a lot of clutter, and is generally
                    well kept. You'd be looking at the basics such as mopping, vacuuming, dusting, wiping surfaces,
                    bathrooms, kitchen, etc. A deep clean is selected for spaces that tend to be cluttered or dirty and
                    need special products and more time to remove dirt, dust, etc., off surfaces.</p>
                <Heading>How far in advance should we book?</Heading>
                <p>Should availability permit, we offer the opportunity to book a day before on the website. For same-day
                    cleanings, please get in touch with us ASAP. </p>
                <Heading>Cancellation Policy?</Heading>
                <p>Should you need to cancel, please allow 24 hours before canceling altogether, or you will be charged
                    a 15% fee for the service selected. However, if you can reschedule, we're happy to cancel free of
                    charge.</p>
